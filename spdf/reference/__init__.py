"""SPDF Reference Implementation - Minimal reader/writer for the .spdf format.

This module provides a minimal, dependency-light implementation of the SPDF
format that can be used as a reference for porting to other languages.

The only dependencies are:
- Python 3.9+ standard library (gzip, sqlite3, json, tempfile)
- numpy (for embedding vectors only)

v1.1 adds support for:
- Embedded model checkpoints for reproducible embeddings
- Multi-model embedding storage (embeddings_v2 table)
